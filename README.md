#### Summary:

    
## 1. Deep ResNet Pre-Activation works well

#### 1.1 Network Architecture Considerations

#### 1.2 Future goal, Recurrent Neural Network +

## 2. Data Augmentation is needed.

#### 2.1 OpenCV is wonderful
#### 2.2 Flipped it

## 3. Know when to stop
#### 3.1 Training strategies
#### 3.2 Becareful to that high learning rate

## 4. From simulator to real RC racing car
