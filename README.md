Driving Behavioral Cloning
==========================

**Status**: Completed

This project is to mimic human driving behavior into a car. 

#### Summary:
  1. [Model Architecture](1-model-architecture) 
  2. [Data Collection and Training](2-data-collection-and-training)
  3. [Autonomous Driving Test](3-autonomous-driving-test-in-simualtor)
  
    

## 1. Deep ResNet Pre-Activation works well

#### 1.1 Network Architecture Considerations

## 2. Data Augmentation is needed.

#### 2.1 OpenCV is

## 3. From Simulator to Real-life
