Driving Behavioral Cloning
==========================

**Status**: Completed

This project is to mimic human driving behavior into a car. 



### Dependencies

This project requires users to have additional libraries installed in order to use. Udacity provided a good solution by sharing  a ready-to-use environment `CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit` for students. Please refer [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/doc/configure_via_anaconda.md) on how to install.

### How to use:

1. Download CarND Udacity Simulator ([here]()]
2. Open car simulator in autonomous mode
3. Open a terminal, run `python drive.py model/cnn.h5` (cnn.h5 is my pre-trained model)
4. Enjoy your first autonomous drive!

#### Result:

| Track 1       | Track 2       |

## 1. Deep ResNet Pre-Activation works well

#### 1.1 Network Architecture Considerations

#### 1.2 Future goal, Recurrent Neural Network +

## 2. Data Augmentation is needed.

#### 2.1 OpenCV is wonderful
#### 2.2 Flipped it

## 3. Know when to stop
#### 3.1 Training strategies
#### 3.2 Becareful to that high learning rate

## 4. From simulator to real RC racing car
